## Introduction:
This project uses the Pygal graphing and charting module to display data. Children collect data and use Pygal to display it using Pie Charts and Bar Graphs.  

## Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ ['Popular Pets' starting point -- jumpto.cc/python-new](http://jumpto.cc/python-new)

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ [‘Popular Pets’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/9339862606](https://trinket.io/python/9339862606)

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ popular-pets/popular-pets.py

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ popular-pets-finished/popular-pets.py
+ popular-pets-finished/pets.txt
+ popular-pets-finished/butterflies.txt
+ popular-pets-finished/piratesinjas.txt

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives
+ Data - Pygal charts and graphs
+ Reading from files

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges
+ Create your own bar chart;
+ Create a bar chart from a file;
+ More charts and graphs!

## Frequently Asked Questions
+ Step 1 asks the volunteer to help the group organise a survey to collect data about favourite pets. If you only have a small number of children working on the project you can use the included sample data or make it up.
+ For the challenges you can either choose to do surveys as a group and record the results on a whiteboard for all club members to use, or you can allow children so do their own surveys and record their own data.
